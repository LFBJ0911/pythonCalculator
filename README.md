# pythonCalculator
A calculator app with Python

My first "finished" project. But who knows if I continue this project.
Please do not use this calculator (there are so many better alternatives).
Although the most important part is that it works and that I have gotten it to work. 

It functioned mainly as exercise on my road to learn Python and programming overall. In essence, this code is open for use. But I'm not familliar yet with the licences for that kind of stuff. 

This calculator is written in Python with help from the tkinter library. I might add menu's and extra buttons and stuff. But it might take another while.
